Log Archive Tool Project

This Bash script archives log files from a specified directory, compresses them into a `.tar.gz` file, and stores them in `/var/log/archive/`. This helps keep the system clean while preserving logs in a compressed format for future reference.

## 🚀 Features
- 📂 Accepts a log directory as an argument.
- 🔥 Compresses logs into a `.tar.gz` archive.
- 📝 Logs the archive operation to a file.
- 🕒 Can be automated using `cron`.
